## reversi.py

This module contains the Reversi game implementation. Reversi is a strategy board game for two players, 
played on an 8Ã—8 uncheckered board. Players take turns placing disks on the board with their assigned color 
facing up. During a play, any disks of the opponent's color that are in a straight line and bounded by the 
disk just placed and another disk of the current player's color are turned over to the current player's color.

The object of the game is to have the majority of disks turned to display your color when the last playable 
empty square is filled.

Classes:
- Reversi: This class represents a Reversi game. It inherits from the Game class and overrides its methods 
  to implement the Reversi game rules.
